<msg type="warning" file="Xst" num="819" delta="old" >&quot;<arg fmt="%s" index="1">//fs-caedm/clkrbj/Documents/320/Lab9/Lab9/rx.vhd</arg>&quot; line <arg fmt="%d" index="2">139</arg>: One or more signals are missing in the process sensitivity list. To enable synthesis of FPGA/CPLD hardware, XST will assume that all necessary signals are present in the sensitivity list. Please note that the result of the synthesis may differ from the initial design specification. The missing signals are:
<arg fmt="%s" index="3">&lt;test_shift&gt;</arg>

<msg type="info" file="Xst" num="2371" delta="old" >HDL ADVISOR - Logic functions respectively driving the data and gate enable inputs of this latch share common terms. This situation will potentially lead to setup/hold violations and, as a result, to simulation problems. This situation may come from an incomplete case statement (all selector values are not covered). You should carefully review if it was in your intentions to describe such a latch.

<msg type="info" file="Xst" num="2169" delta="old" >HDL ADVISOR - Some clock signals were not automatically buffered by XST with BUFG/BUFR resources. Please use the buffer_type constraint in order to insert these buffers to the clock signals to help prevent skew problems.
